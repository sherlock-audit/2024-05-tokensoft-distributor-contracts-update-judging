# `Adjust()` would lead to loss of user's fund.

## Summary
AdvancedDistributor :: `Adjust()` would lead to loss of user's fund
## Vulnerability Detail
- Whenever a owner adjusts the claim amount of user then we would not able to claim his tokens forever as while adjusting the token amount the owner does not updates the merkle root.
- Now whenever user claims his token with adjusted amount  he would not be able to claim his tokens and it would fail inside `validMerkleProof` modifier as merkle Root has not been updated leading to loss of user's fund.
## Impact
- Loss of User's fund as he cannot claim the tokens.
