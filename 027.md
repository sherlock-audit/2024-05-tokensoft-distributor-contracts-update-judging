# Inconsistency in the allowed times for claiming

## Summary
Inconsistency in the allowed times for claiming
## Vulnerability Detail
There are 2 different vesting types - using tranches or vesting linearly. There is an inconsistency upon the timestamp when a user is allowed to fully claim his tokens between those 2 different types.

Here is when a user is allowed to fully claim his tokens when they are vesting in tranches:
```solidity
if (time - delay > tranches[i].time) {
                return tranches[i].vestedFraction;
            }
```
The `time` value of the tranche must be passed.
Here is when a user is allowed to fully claim his tokens when they are vesting linearly:
```solidity
if (delayedTime >= end) {
            return fractionDenominator;
        }
```
He can claim them as soon as the `end` timestamp occurs. This is inconsistent and allows people that are receiving their tokens linearly to actually be able to claim them earlier.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Fix the inconsistency by allowing users to claim at the `end/time` timestamp or after it, depending on your preferences.
