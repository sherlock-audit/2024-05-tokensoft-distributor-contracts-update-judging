# Users are unable to claim their tokens

## Summary
Users are unable to claim their tokens
## Vulnerability Detail
Upon claiming using `PerAddressContinuousVestingMerkleDistributor` or `PerAddressTrancheVestingMerkleDistributor`, the flow goes through `AdvancedDistributor#_executeClaim()` which receives the data about how the vesting is supposed to happen.
```solidity
function _executeClaim(address beneficiary, uint256 totalAmount, bytes memory)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        returns (uint256 _claimed)
    {
        _claimed = super._executeClaim(beneficiary, totalAmount, new bytes(0));
        _reconcileVotingPower(beneficiary);
    }
```
The issue here is that the data received as the third parameter is completely omitted and instead, `bytes(0)` is used as the data. That is later decoded into the according type (tranches or cliff, start and end) but that will revert essentially disallowing users from claiming.
## Impact
Users are unable to claim their tokens
