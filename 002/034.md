# Arithmetic Overflow and Underflow Vulnerabilities in `adjust` Function

## Summary
The `adjust` function in the smart contract is designed to modify the quantity of tokens claimable by a user (beneficiary). However, it lacks safeguards against arithmetic overflows and underflows, posing significant security risks.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function performs arithmetic operations (addition and subtraction) without any checks for `overflows` or `underflows`. This can result in incorrect token balances or potentially allow for manipulation of the contractâ€™s state.
## Impact
* Without proper checks, an overflow in the addition operations can cause the total tokens and beneficiary's tokens to wrap around, leading to incorrect balances.
* An underflow in the subtraction operations can similarly cause unexpected large values, allowing beneficiaries to claim more tokens than intended.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement the `SafeMath` library from OpenZeppelin to handle all arithmetic operations. This will automatically manage `overflow` and `underflow` conditions, ensuring the safe execution of addition and subtraction.
