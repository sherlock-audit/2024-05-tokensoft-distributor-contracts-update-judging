# Inadequate check on token amount adjustment

## Summary
The `AdvancedDistributor::adjust()` function decreases the allocated token amount of a user without adequately checking against the claimed token amount. This can lead to a scenario where the decreased token amount is greater than the pending claimable token amount, resulting in insufficient token balance in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
For example, assume `distributionRecord.total = 1000e18` and `records[beneficiary].claimed = 800e18`:

1. Execute the `adjust()` function with `amount = -900e18`.
2. Since the condition `distributionRecord.total >= diff` is true, `distributionRecord.total` will be updated to 100e18, and 900e18 tokens will be transferred out from the contract.
3. The beneficiary then claims 100e18.

As a result, the contract will end up distributing a total of 800e18 + 900e18 + 100e18 tokens, causing a deficit in the contract's token balance.

## Impact
Insufficient token balance could fail the token claiming.
