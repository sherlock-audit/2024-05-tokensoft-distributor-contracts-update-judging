# off by 1 case `diff < type(uint120).max` in adjust function

## Summary
While during adjustment of distribution record the check for diff value is off by one.

## Vulnerability Detail
The owner will call the `adjust` function to override the distribution record of users. To do so the owner will provide the user address and the amount to override the record by.
```solidity
2024-05-tokensoft-distributor-contracts-update/contracts/packages/hardhat/contracts/claim/factory/AdvancedDistributorInitializable.sol:124
124:     function adjust(address beneficiary, int256 amount) external onlyOwner {
125:         DistributionRecord memory distributionRecord = records[beneficiary];
126:         require(distributionRecord.initialized, "must initialize before adjusting");
127: 
128:         uint256 diff = uint256(amount > 0 ? amount : -amount);
129:         require(diff < type(uint120).max, "adjustment > max uint120");
130: 
131:         if (amount < 0) {
132:             // decreasing claimable tokens
133:             require(total >= diff, "decrease greater than distributor total");
134:             require(distributionRecord.total >= diff, "decrease greater than distributionRecord total");
135:             total -= diff;
136:             records[beneficiary].total -= uint120(diff);
137:             token.safeTransfer(owner(), diff);
138:         } else {
139:             // increasing claimable tokens
140:             total += diff;
141:             records[beneficiary].total += uint120(diff);
142:         }
143:         _reconcileVotingPower(beneficiary);
144:         emit Adjust(beneficiary, amount);
145:     }
```
`129` it can be observed that diff must be less then `type(uint120).max`.  which is wrong as we have allowed the user to receive `type(uint120).max` value. if the owner want to reset the user to 0, the owner must provide `type(uint120).max` value to override user distribution record to `0`.
lets assume :
1. Alice is illegible to receive `type(uint120).max` value .
2. The owner decided to reset Alice record to 0.
3. The owner Provided `type(uint120).max` negative value to override the user record.
4. The contract will revert because of `require(diff < type(uint120).max, "adjustment > max uint120");`


## Impact
The user Distribution record will not be override if its value is `type(uint120).max`. although its a big value but could be possible in vesting because the vesting occur on long duration.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
change following condition:
From :
```solidity
require(diff < type(uint120).max, "adjustment > max uint120");
``` 
To:
```solidity
require(diff <= type(uint120).max, "adjustment > max uint120");
```
