# 0 data input might break functionality

## Summary
0 data input might break functionality

## Vulnerability Detail
In the scope there are contracts that have a default implementation and an initializable one. The only difference between the two should be that the initializable one should follow the upgradability pattern. However `AdvancedDistributor.sol` & `AdvancedDistributorInitializable.sol` have different function parameters:

`AdvancedDistributor.sol`:
```solidity
    function _executeClaim(address beneficiary, uint256 totalAmount, bytes memory data)
       internal 
       virtual 
       override 
       returns (uint256 _claimed) 
    {
       _claimed = super._executeClaim(beneficiary, totalAmount, data);
       _reconcileVotingPower(beneficiary);
    }
```
`AdvancedDistributorInitializable.sol`:
```solidity
    function _executeClaim(address beneficiary, uint256 totalAmount, bytes memory)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        returns (uint256 _claimed)
    {
        _claimed = super._executeClaim(beneficiary, totalAmount, new bytes(0));
        _reconcileVotingPower(beneficiary);
    }
```
As you can see the second one calls the `super._executeClaim` with 0 data instead of using the data from the input.


## Impact
I'm not sure what effect this might have but the other contracts that have an initializable implementation only use the upgradability pattern and don't change anything else in the code. Perhaps this might break some functionality as some functions require data to be used. 

Here is how the execution continues after calling `super._executeClaim`:
`_executeClaim()` -> `getClaimableAmount()` -> `getVestedFraction()`

`getVestedFraction()` is in most of the files so it's confusing to determine which implementation actually gets called. But here is one of the implementations of `getVestedFraction()` that requires data in order to work:

```solidity
    function getVestedFraction(address beneficiary, uint256 time, bytes memory data) public view override returns (uint256) {
        Tranche[] memory tranches = abi.decode(data, (Tranche[]));

        uint256 delay = getFairDelayTime(beneficiary);
        for (uint256 i = tranches.length; i != 0;) {
            unchecked {
                --i;
            }

            if (time - delay > tranches[i].time) {
                return tranches[i].vestedFraction;
            }
        }
```

## Recommendation
Use consistent code when implementing initializable versions of contracts.
