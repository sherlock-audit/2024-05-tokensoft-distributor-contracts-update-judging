# Users will not be able to claim their tokens

## Summary
Users will not be able to claim their tokens
## Vulnerability Detail
Upon calling `PerAddressContinuousVestingMerkle#claim()`, users provide data that is first checked for validity using merkle trees.
```solidity
function claim(
    uint256 index, // the beneficiary's index in the merkle root
    address beneficiary, // the address that will receive tokens
    uint256 totalAmount, // the total claimable by this beneficiary
    uint256 start, // the start of the vesting period
    uint256 cliff, // cliff time
    uint256 end, // the end of the vesting period
    bytes32[] calldata merkleProof
  )
    external
    validMerkleProof(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(index, beneficiary, totalAmount, start, cliff, end)), merkleProof)
    nonReentrant
  {
    // effects
    uint256 claimedAmount = _executeClaim(beneficiary, totalAmount, new bytes(0));
    // interactions
    _settleClaim(beneficiary, claimedAmount);
  }
```
The issue here is that the third parameter of the function that is called, `_executeClaim()`, expects the data about how the vesting is supposed to happen as the third parameter. In this case, this should be the encoded `start, cliff and end`. However, as seen above, it actually just uses `bytes(0)` as the data which is later decoded like that:
```solidity
(uint256 start, uint256 cliff, uint256 end) = abi.decode(data, (uint256, uint256, uint256));
```
That will revert making the users unable to claim their tokens.
## Impact
Users will not be able to claim their tokens

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Encode the `start, cliff and end` and pass them as the data.
