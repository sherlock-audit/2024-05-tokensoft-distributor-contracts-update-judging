# PerAddressContinuousVestingMerkleDistributor.claim always reverts

## Summary

PerAddressContinuousVestingMerkleDistributor.claim always reverts

## Vulnerability Detail

PerAddressContinuousVestingMerkleDistributor.claim passes in `new bytes(0)` instead of the (start, cliff, end) parameters of the vesting schedule. However, the recipient of this data attempts to decode it as (uint256, uint256, uint256), and thus always fails.

## Impact

People cannot claim token from a PerAddressContinuousVestingMerkleDistributor

There is a separate issue where AdvancedDistributorInitializable ignores its data argument and passes in new bytes(0) as well. However, these two issues are independent.

## Code Snippet

From

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-tokensoft-distributor-contracts-update/blob/main/contracts/packages/hardhat/contracts/claim/factory/PerAddressContinuousVestingMerkleDistributor.sol#L66C1-L67C1

```solidity
        uint256 claimedAmount = super._executeClaim(beneficiary, totalAmount, new bytes(0));
```

This is intended to be forwarded to 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-tokensoft-distributor-contracts-update/blob/main/contracts/packages/hardhat/contracts/claim/factory/PerAddressContinuousVestingInitializable.sol#L30C1-L36C1

```solidity
    function getVestedFraction(
        address beneficiary,
        uint256 time, // time is in seconds past the epoch (e.g. block.timestamp)
        bytes memory data
    ) public view override returns (uint256) {
        (uint256 start, uint256 cliff, uint256 end) = abi.decode(data, (uint256, uint256, uint256));
```

And hence always reverts

Pass an encoding of the vesting schedule along
