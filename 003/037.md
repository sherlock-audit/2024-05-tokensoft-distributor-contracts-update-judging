# Malicious users can gain more vote shares after `voteFactor` is changed.

## Summary

Malicious users can gain more votes after `voteFactor` is changed.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current protocol design, the user's vote count will be updated during `initializeDistributionRecord` and `claim`. It is worth noting that there is no access control for these two methods. The owner can change `voteFactor`, but the user's vote count will not be directly affected (instead will take effect the next time `initializeDistributionRecord` or `claim` is called). Therefore, an attacker can use this to increase his or her vote share.

When `voteFactor` is reduced, the attacker calls the `claim` function with other beneficiariesâ€™ address as arguments, thereby reducing their vote count. When the `voteFactor` increases, the user calls the `initializeDistributionRecord` function with his/her own address. Ultimately in both cases the attacker's vote share will be increased.

## Impact

Malicious users could increase their vote shares.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change the way the user's votes are calculated. Use balanceOf to get the shares, and then convert to votes using tokensToVotes. **In this way, the user's vote count will take effect immediately after the voteFactor changes**, instead of requiring the user to actively trigger an update (i.e., call function initialize or claim).

For example, use this way to get votes:

```solidity
  function getVotes(address beneficiary) public view returns (uint256) {
    DistributionRecord memory record = records[beneficiary];
    uint256 currentShare = balanceOf(beneficiary);
    return tokensToVotes(currentShares);
  }
```

Then the function _reconcileVotingPower will be:

```solidity
  // Update voting power based on distribution record initialization or claims
  function _reconcileVotingPower(address beneficiary) private {
    // current share
    uint256 currentShare = balanceOf(beneficiary);
    // correct share after initialization, claim, or adjustment
    DistributionRecord memory record = records[beneficiary];
    uint256 newShare = record.claimed >= record.total ? 0 : record.total - record.claimed;

    if (currentShare > newShare) {
      // reduce voting power through ERC20Votes extension
      _burn(beneficiary, currentShare - newShare);
    } else if (currentShare  < newShare) {
      // increase voting power through ERC20Votes extension
      _mint(beneficiary, newShare - currentShare);
    }
  }
```
