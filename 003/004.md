# Malicious users can use more votes than they are supposed to have

## Summary
Malicious users can use more votes than they are supposed to have
## Vulnerability Detail
Users have a certain amount of voting tokens based on their unclaimed tokens and the voting factor. DAOs integrating the protocol would let users vote for important decisions using their voting tokens. However, users can use more votes than they are supposed to have because of an issue with the protocol.

Imagine the following scenario:
1. Bob has 100 unclaimed tokens and the vote factor is 2, thus he is supposed to have 200 voting tokens (we are ignoring `fractionDenominator` for simplicity purposes)
2. An admin decides to change the voting factor to 1:
```solidity
function setVoteFactor(uint256 _voteFactor) external onlyOwner {
        voteFactor = _voteFactor;
        emit SetVoteFactor(voteFactor);
    }
```
3. Now, Bob is supposed to have 100 voting tokens, however they are still not updated as `_reconcileVotingPower()` has not been called
4. Bob decides to vote on an important proposal and votes with his full balance of 200 voting tokens
5. The protocol integrating would have to call `_reconcileVotingPower()` for every voter to make sure their voting power is actually updated however the issue is that the function is private

This essentially allows Bob to still vote with 200 tokens despite him only actually having access to 100. The `_reconcileVotingPower()` function can only be called using other functions in the `AdvancedDistributorInitializable` contract however these functions have a completely different goal and purpose and the protocol integrating is definitely not supposed to be calling them just to update the voting power of a voter.
