# There is a chance that the beneficiary won't be able to claim the rest of his tokens

## Summary
Instead of the beneficiary being able to claim the rest of his available tokens he won't be able to.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the `_executeClaim` function is called for the beneficiary. This is how this function is represented:

```solidity
function _executeClaim(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 _totalAmount,
    bytes memory data
  ) internal virtual returns (uint256) {
    uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);

    // effects
    if (records[beneficiary].total != totalAmount) {
      // re-initialize if the total has been updated
      _initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);
    }
    
    uint120 claimableAmount = uint120(getClaimableAmount(beneficiary, data));
    require(claimableAmount > 0, 'Distributor: no more tokens claimable right now');

    records[beneficiary].claimed += claimableAmount;
    claimed += claimableAmount;

    return claimableAmount;
  }
```
As we can see the `claimableAmount` variable is set by calling the `getClaimableAmount` function. Which is represented like this:
```solidity
 function getClaimableAmount(address beneficiary, bytes memory data) public view virtual returns (uint256) {
    require(records[beneficiary].initialized, 'Distributor: claim not initialized');

    DistributionRecord memory record = records[beneficiary];

    uint256 claimable = (record.total * getVestedFraction(beneficiary, block.timestamp, data)) /
      fractionDenominator;
    return
      record.claimed >= claimable
        ? 0 // no more tokens to claim
        : claimable - record.claimed; // claim all available tokens
  }
```
Now let's say that the beneficiary had claimed before and the `record.claimed` has a value of 100e18 for example. After some time when the `_executeClaim` function is called again and the `claimableAmount` needs to be calculated, and this math happens `uint256 claimable = (record.total * getVestedFraction(beneficiary, block.timestamp, data)) /
      fractionDenominator;`.  And if the result is less than 100e18, let's say 50e18. The value that the `getClaimableAmount` function will return will be 0 because the `claimable` will be less than the `record.claimed`. This will happen because of this line of code:
```solidity
 return
      record.claimed >= claimable
        ? 0 // no more tokens to claim
        : claimable - record.claimed; // claim all available tokens
```
Instead of the beneficiary being able to claim those available tokens he will lose them, because when the `claimableAmount ` variable is set to 0 in the `_executeClaim` function this function will revert because of this line of code:
```solidity
 require(claimableAmount > 0, 'Distributor: no more tokens claimable right now');
```

## Impact
The beneficiary can have his available tokens for claiming set to 0 instead of him being able to claim them.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the check which checks if the `record.claimed` is more than or equal to `claimable`.
