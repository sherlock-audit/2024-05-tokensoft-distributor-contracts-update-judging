# Claim Function Immediately Distributes Tokens without Start, End, and Cliff Calculation in `PerAddressContinuousVestingMerkle`


## Summary

The `PerAddressContinuousVestingMerkle` contract allows beneficiaries to claim their entire token allocation immediately due to the improper handling of the data field in the `_executeClaim` function. When data is passed as an empty byte array, it leads to immediate token distribution without considering the start, end, and cliff parameters.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation, when the data parameter is passed as an empty byte array `new bytes(0)` to the `_executeClaim` function, it results in immediate token distribution. This bypasses the intended vesting schedule and cliff periods.

```solidity
  {
    // effects
    uint256 claimedAmount = _executeClaim(beneficiary, totalAmount, new bytes(0));
    // interactions
    _settleClaim(beneficiary, claimedAmount);
  }
```

In `AdvancedDistributor::_executeClaim` the `super._executeClaim` function is called:

```solidity
  function _executeClaim(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 totalAmount,
    bytes memory data
  ) internal virtual override returns (uint256 _claimed) {
    _claimed = super._executeClaim(beneficiary, totalAmount, data);
    _reconcileVotingPower(beneficiary);
  }
```

Within `Distributor::_executeClaim`, the `getClaimableAmount` function is invoked to determine the amount a user can claim:

```solidity
  function _executeClaim(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 _totalAmount,
    bytes memory data
  ) internal virtual returns (uint256) {
    uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);

    // effects
    if (records[beneficiary].total != totalAmount) {
      // re-initialize if the total has been updated
      _initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);
    }

@>>    uint120 claimableAmount = uint120(getClaimableAmount(beneficiary, data));
    require(claimableAmount > 0, 'Distributor: no more tokens claimable right now');

    records[beneficiary].claimed += claimableAmount;
    claimed += claimableAmount;

    return claimableAmount;
  }
```

In `getClaimableAmount`, the claimable amount is calculated and the `getVestedFraction` function is called with data parameter having `new bytes(0)` value.

```solidity
  function getClaimableAmount(address beneficiary, bytes memory data) public view virtual returns (uint256) {
    require(records[beneficiary].initialized, 'Distributor: claim not initialized');

    DistributionRecord memory record = records[beneficiary];

@>>    uint256 claimable = (record.total * getVestedFraction(beneficiary, block.timestamp, data)) /
      fractionDenominator;
    return
      record.claimed >= claimable
        ? 0 // no more tokens to claim
        : claimable - record.claimed; // claim all available tokens
  }
```

In the `PerAddressContinuousVesting::getVestedFraction` function, the values of start, cliff, and end are decoded from the provided data parameter. However, if data is empty, these values default to zero.

When delayedTime is calculated, it results in a value greater than zero because `getFairDelayTime` never returns a value equal to or greater than block.timestamp. If `getFairDelayTime` were larger than the current time, the function would revert.

As a result, the first if condition (delayedTime <= cliff) is bypassed. The second if condition (delayedTime >= end) is met, causing the function to return `fractionDenominator` without considering the intended start or cliff times.

```solidity
	function getVestedFraction(
		address beneficiary,
		uint256 time, // time is in seconds past the epoch (e.g. block.timestamp)
    bytes memory data
	) public view override returns (uint256) {
@>>    (uint256 start, uint256 cliff, uint256 end) = abi.decode(data, (uint256, uint256, uint256));

		uint256 delayedTime = time- getFairDelayTime(beneficiary);
		// no tokens are vested
		if (delayedTime <= cliff) {
			return 0;
		}

		// all tokens are vested
		if (delayedTime >= end) {
@>>			return fractionDenominator;
		}

		// some tokens are vested
		return (fractionDenominator * (delayedTime - start)) / (end - start);
	}
```

This leads to the following calculation:

```solidity
    uint256 claimable = (record.total * getVestedFraction(beneficiary, block.timestamp, data)) /
      fractionDenominator;
```

Which simplifies to:

`claimable = (record.total * 1e18) / 1e18; // full amount claim`

So, based on the implementation, if `bytes(0)` is passed to `getVestedFraction`, all tokens are vested immediately, and the user can claim all their tokens without considering the start of the vesting period or cliff time.

**Simple Scenario:**

Users Details in Merkle Tree:

- Alice is entitled to 1000 tokens. Her distribution starts on January 1, 2024, with a cliff period of 6 months, and ends on January 1, 2026.
- These details are encoded and stored as part of a Merkle tree, whose root is stored in the contract.

Alice Initializes Her Distribution Record:

- Alice wants to initialize her distribution record to start receiving her vested tokens.
- She submits the following details to the initializeDistributionRecord function:
  - index: Her position in the Merkle tree (e.g., 5).
  - beneficiary: Her address.
  - amount: 1000 tokens.
  - start: January 1, 2024.
  - cliff: 6 months.
  - end: January 1, 2026.
  - merkleProof: The proof that her details are part of the Merkle tree.

Verification and Initialization:

- The contract verifies the provided Merkle proof against the stored Merkle root.
- If the proof is valid, the contract calls `_initializeDistributionRecord` for Alice, setting up her initial record in the vesting schedule.

Alice Claims Her Tokens:

- Due to the vulnerability, Alice can call the `_executeClaim` function with an empty data parameter (bytes(0)).
- The function bypasses the intended start, cliff, and end time checks.
- Alice is able to claim her entire 1000 tokens immediately, ignoring the vesting schedule.

## Impact

This vulnerability allows `beneficiaries` to claim their entire token allocation immediately, bypassing the intended vesting schedule and cliff periods. This could lead to premature token distribution.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure that the data parameter in the `_executeClaim` function is correctly populated with the vesting schedule parameters (start, cliff, and end times). Implement validation checks to prevent an empty byte array (`bytes(0)`) from bypassing the vesting logic.
