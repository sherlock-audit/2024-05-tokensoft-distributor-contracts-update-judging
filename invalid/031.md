# User balance is not updated when changing voteFactor

## Summary
When [changing voteFactor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-tokensoft-distributor-contracts-update/blob/67edd899612619b0acefdcb0783ef7a8a75caeac/contracts/packages/hardhat/contracts/claim/abstract/AdvancedDistributor.sol#L191-L193), the [user's balance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-tokensoft-distributor-contracts-update/blob/67edd899612619b0acefdcb0783ef7a8a75caeac/contracts/packages/hardhat/contracts/claim/abstract/AdvancedDistributor.sol#L80C28-L80C51) was not updated. An attacker can monitor this transaction and vote before the balance is updated, thereby gaining more voting power.

## Vulnerability Detail
For example, if voteFactor increases, the voting rights of all users should increase. However, users' voting rights are not updated in time. Attackers can vote immediately after updating their voting rights, thus accounting for a larger proportion. If voteFactor decreases, the voting rights of all users should decrease, and attackers can preempt transactions. Vote before updates to have greater voting power.

## Impact
The attacker may have more voting power.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function setVoteFactor(uint256 _voteFactor) external onlyOwner {
    voteFactor = _voteFactor;
    emit SetVoteFactor(voteFactor);
  }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the balances of all users when voteFactor is updated.
