# FairQueue::_setPseudoRandomValue can be manipulated by validators

## Summary

`FairQueue::_setPseudoRandomValue` can be manipulated by validators, meaning the `randomValue` generated is not safe to use and private events are not safe to use this functionality either, even though code comments state this is safe.

## Vulnerability Detail
[FairQueue::_setPseudorandomValue()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-tokensoft-distributor-contracts-update/blob/main/contracts/packages/hardhat/contracts/utilities/FairQueue.sol#L33-L40)
```solidity
  /**
   * @dev internal function to set the random value. A salt (e.g. from a merkle root) is required to prevent
   * naive manipulation of the random value by validators
   */
  function _setPseudorandomValue(uint160 salt) internal {
    if (distancePerSecond == 0) {
      // there is no delay: random value is not needed
      return;
    }
    require(salt > 0, 'I demand more randomness');
    randomValue = uint160(uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1))) ^ salt;
  }
```
The usage of the `salt` value was intended to be utilised to prevent manipulation of the `randomValue` by validators. However even with the use of the `salt` the `randomValue` is still manipulatable by validators as they control/ can influence `block.number` and `blockhash`.

[FairQueue.sol#L5-L8](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-tokensoft-distributor-contracts-update/blob/main/contracts/packages/hardhat/contracts/utilities/FairQueue.sol#L5-L8)
```solidity
 * @dev The delay is determined by calculating a distance between the user's address and a pseudorandom value based on a provided salt and a blockhash
 * using the XOR distance metric. Do not use this contract if the event is public because users could grind addresses until they find one with a low delay.
```
The code comments state that the functionality is only unsafe during a public event, however private events are also unsafe, as even though only selected addresses can participate, meaning users cannot brute force generate addresses close to the `randomValue`, the validators can still affect `randomValue` to make it close to other already known addresses.

## Impact

Validators are still able to manipulate the `randomValue` even with the use of the provided `salt` value. This means they can have an impact on what value is utilised for calculating the `fairDelayTime` which can allow them to manipulate this value in their own or other user's favour to get a low distance from their own address, gaining an advantage and breaking the system.

This is especially important as the `FairQueue` code comments state that private events should be safe to utilise this functionality as they cannot force to get addresses close to the `randomValue` distance, however validators can influence the `randomValue` value itself, meaning they can manipulate the game through manipulation of the `randomValue` even for private event.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Utilise a random number service such as `Chainlink VRF` to get the random number, this will ensure that validator can have no effect on `randomValue` which should make the functionality safer to use for a private event.
