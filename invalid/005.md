# In `Registry.sol` in the `register` function the first user can't be registered.

## Summary
The admin won't be able to register the first user in the `register`  function.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is the `register` function:
```solidity
function register(address addressRegistered, bytes4[] calldata interfaceIds)
		public
		onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE)
	{
		for (uint256 i = interfaceIds.length; i != 0; ) {
			interfaces[addressRegistered][interfaceIds[i - 1]] = true;
			unchecked {
				--i;
			}
		}

		emit Register(addressRegistered, interfaceIds, msg.sender);
	}
```

When the time comes for the admin to register the first user he won't be able to because of this line of code in the `register` function:
```solidity
for (uint256 i = interfaceIds.length; i != 0; )
```
This line sets the value of `i` as the `interfaceIds.length` but when the admin tries to register the first user the length of the `bytes4[] interfaceIds` array will be 0 because there are no users registered, and the `i != 0` check will revert. This will make the `register` function always revert because there will be no way for the admin to register the first user.

## Impact
The `register` function won't work because the first user can't be registered.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Just put a check to see if the user was previously registered or not, and if he was not registered previously set `interfaces[addressRegistered][interfaceIds]` to true if he was registered prior to this just revert.
