# Many distributor creation transaction with valid merkle root will revert because of a downcasting

## Summary

A downcasting from uint256 to uint160 makes many creation of distributions using a valid merkle root to revert. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Solidity truncates the higher-order bits when downcast, it doesn't fail or revert. In order to create a `salt` for the FairQueue to create a pseudorandom value the bytes of the merkle root is processed as a downcast `uint160(uint256(byte32))` that truncates the higher-order bits but FairQueue when creates the pseudorandom number it reverts if the salt is 0 with message "I demand more randomness".
So there are many merkle roots that will fail when creating a distribution, every merkle root that has the pattern `0xffffffffffffffffffffffff0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` where  `ffffffffffffffffffffffff` can be any hex combination when is downcasted to uint160 will be 0 and therefore the transaction will revert.

Affected Distributions:
- ContinuousVestingMerkle
- CrosschainMerkleDistributor
- CrosschainTrancheVestingMerkle
- PerAddressContinuousVestingMerkle
- PerAddressTrancheVestingMerkle
- TrancheVestingMerkle

POC

```javascript
➜ uint256 merkleroot = 0xffffffffffffffffffffffff0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
➜ uint160 salt = uint160(merkleroot);
➜ salt
Type: uint160
├ Hex: 0x
├ Hex (full word): 0x0
└ Decimal: 0
```

## Impact

All transactions that creates a merkle distribution with valid merkleroot that match the mentioned pattern will revert with message: "I demand more randomness"

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I would not downcast and accept all possible merkle roots using a uint256 instead of a uint160 to create the pseudo random number

```javascript
  function _setPseudorandomValue(uint160 salt) internal { // @audit modify this to uint256 salt and generate a psudo random number without overflowing
    if (distancePerSecond == 0) {
      return;
    }
    require(salt > 0, 'I demand more randomness');
    randomValue = uint160(uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1))) ^ salt;
  }
  ```
