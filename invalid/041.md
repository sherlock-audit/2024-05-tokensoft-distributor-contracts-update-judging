# Wrong voteFactor is initilized in PerAddressContinuousVestingInitializable.sol

## Summary
In  PerAddressContinuousVestingInitializable.sol voting power of 1x is intended which implies that the fraction denominator and the vote factor should be equal but currently the vote factor is intialised to a wrong value which decreases the voting power to 10**14 times less than 1x(intended) voting power.
## Vulnerability Detail
Following is __ContinuousVesting_init function which performs various other required initialization
```solidity
 function __ContinuousVesting_init(
        IERC20 _token,
        uint256 _total,
        string memory _uri,
        uint160 _maxDelayTime,
        uint160 _salt,
        address _owner
    ) internal onlyInitializing {
        __AdvancedDistributor_init(
            _token,
            _total,
            _uri,
            10000, // 1x voting power
            10 ** 18, // provides the highest resolution possible for continuous vesting
            _maxDelayTime,
            _salt,
            _owner
        );
    }
```
As can be seen from the comments that the intended voting power is 1x.
Now _AdvancedDistributor_init function is as follows
```solidity
function __AdvancedDistributor_init(
        IERC20 _token,
        uint256 _total,
        string memory _uri,
        uint256 _voteFactor,
        uint256 _fractionDenominator,
        uint160 _maxDelayTime,
        uint160 _salt,
        address _owner
    ) internal onlyInitializing {
        _setSweepRecipient(payable(_owner));
        voteFactor = _voteFactor;
        emit SetVoteFactor(voteFactor);

        __Distributor_init(_token, _total, _uri, _fractionDenominator);
        __FairQueue_init(_maxDelayTime, _salt);
    }
```
From the above function it is clear that it accepts the 4th parameter as vote factor and 5th parameter as fraction denominator
Now key thing to note is that initially in _ConitnousVesting_init function vote factor is set as 10000 and Fraction denominator is set as 10 **18.
So now vote factor = 10000
fraction denominator = 10 **18

Now lets see the following function 
```solidity
/**
     * @notice Set the voting power of undistributed tokens
     * @param _voteFactor The voting power multiplier as a fraction of fractionDenominator
     * @dev The vote factor can be any integer. If voteFactor / fractionDenominator == 1,
     * one unclaimed token provides one vote. If voteFactor / fractionDenominator == 2, one
     * unclaimed token counts as two votes.
     */
    function setVoteFactor(uint256 _voteFactor) external onlyOwner {
        voteFactor = _voteFactor;
        emit SetVoteFactor(voteFactor);
    }
```
It is clear from the comments mentioned that in order to acheive 1x voting power vote factor should be equal to fraction Denominator which is not followed in the above explained scenario.
## Impact
This causes wrong issuance of voting power to the users. Mentioning this as high finding because it causes users less voting power than they should receive thus loss of voting tokens for the users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the vote factor to 10**18
```solidity
function __ContinuousVesting_init(
        IERC20 _token,
        uint256 _total,
        string memory _uri,
        uint160 _maxDelayTime,
        uint160 _salt,
        address _owner
    ) internal onlyInitializing {
        __AdvancedDistributor_init(
            _token,
            _total,
            _uri,
@==>           10**18, // 1x voting power
            10 ** 18, // provides the highest resolution possible for continuous vesting
            _maxDelayTime,
            _salt,
            _owner
        );
    }
```
