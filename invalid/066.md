# Rounding issue in tokensToVotes()

## Summary
Rounding issue in tokensToVotes() 
## Vulnerability Detail
- If the token used is of 6 decimals then it would create rounding error in  tokensToVotes() 
- As we can see fractionDenominator is set to 10**18 , this would create problem for tokens who have 6 decimals.

- Inside tokensToVotes()
(tokenAmount * voteFactor) / fractionDenominator
if tokenAmount has 6 decimals then it would create a rounding error as tokenAmount is in 6 decimal while fractionDenominator is of 18 decimals which rounds down number to zero.
- Eg . 5 * 1e6 * 2 / 10**18, this would round down to zero even if user has deposited 5*10**6 tokens thus he has zero voting power.
- And in readme it is stated that they would be using USDC so this issue would be very much likely.
## Impact
- tokensToVotes() would round down to zero and his voting power would be zero.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Use more precision to avoid rounding.
