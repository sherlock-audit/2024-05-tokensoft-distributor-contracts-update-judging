# `randomValue` can only be set once

## Summary
@dev's invariant is not followed. Random value can never be upgraded once deployed and the same random value is used for new beneficiary, or whenever added through Merkle root initialization.

## Vulnerability Detail

The @dev says that to shuffle the delays for all addresses, the random value has to be recomputed by calling `_setPseudorandomValue`. But the `FairQueueInitializable` lacks a function to update the random value and it is updated only once at deployment.

The random value also has to be updated whenever the merkle root is changed. So lack of function implementation to update this is the issue. Also, admin can create a new vesting clone, but the funds will be vesting he has to stop it by sweeping to move all tokens to new vesting clones. It is gas-costing and error-prone, the natspec commentent's invariant is broken. There should be an admin-controlled function to recompute random value.

38:     function _setPseudorandomValue(uint160 salt) internal {
39:         if (distancePerSecond == 0) {
41:             return;
42:         }
43:         require(salt > 0, "I demand more randomness");
44:         randomValue = uint160(uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1))) ^ salt;
45:     }
```

## Impact
@dev's invariant is not followed. Random value can never be upgraded once deployed and the same random value is used for new beneficiary, or whenever added through Merkle root initialization.

## Recommendation

Add to `AdvancedDistributor.sol` to make sure it is access-controlled.
